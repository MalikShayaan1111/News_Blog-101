                <h3>Intro:</h3>
                <p>
                    Jinnah was the leader of the All-India Muslim League and is best known for his advocacy for a separate Muslim state, which led to the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan in 1947. His vision and leadership were instrumental in the formation of Pakistan as an independent nation for Muslims in the Indian subcontinent.

                <h3>Who Was He?</h3>

                <p>
                    Jinnah served as Pakistan's first Governor-General until his death in 1948. His legacy continues to be a subject of discussion and debate, both in Pakistan and globally, regarding his political ideologies, his role in the partition, and the future trajectory of Pakistan as a nation. If there have been any recent developments or news about Muhammad Ali Jinnah since my last update, I wouldn't have that information.

                <h3>As Governor-General Of Pakistan</h3>
                <p>
                    The Radcliffe Commission, dividing Bengal and Punjab, completed its work and reported to Mountbatten on 12 August; the last Viceroy held the maps until the 17th, not wanting to spoil the independence celebrations in both nations. There had already been ethnically charged violence and movement of populations; publication of the Radcliffe Line dividing the new nations sparked mass migration, murder, and ethnic cleansing. Many on the "wrong side" of the lines fled or were murdered, or murdered others, hoping to make facts on the ground which would reverse the commission's verdict. Radcliffe wrote in his report that he knew that neither side would be happy with his award; he declined his fee for the work.[171] Christopher Beaumont, Radcliffe's private secretary, later wrote that Mountbatten "must take the blame—though not the sole blame—for the massacres in the Punjab in which between 500,000 to a million men, women and children perished".[172] As many as 14.5 million people relocated between India and Pakistan during and after partition.2007 Jinnah did what he could for the eight million people who migrated to Pakistan; although by now over 70 and frail from lung ailments, he travelled across West Pakistan and personally supervised the provision of aid.[173] According to Ahmed, "What Pakistan needed desperately in those early months was a symbol of the state, one that would unify people and give them the courage and resolve to succeed."[174]

                <h3>Family and childhood</h3>
                <p>
                    Jinnah's given name at birth was Mahomedali Jinnahbhai, and he likely was born in 1876,[b] to Jinnahbhai Poonja and his wife Mithibai, in a rented apartment on the second floor of Wazir Mansion near Karachi,[1] now in Sindh, Pakistan, but then within the Bombay Presidency of British India. Jinnah's paternal grandfather lived in Gondal state in Kathiawar peninsula (now in Gujarat, India).[2][3] He was a Khoja of Nizari Isma'ili Shia Muslim background from Gujarat, though Jinnah later followed the Twelver Shi'a teachings.[4][5] After his death, his relatives and other witnesses claimed that he had converted in later life to the Sunni sect of Islam.[2]
                
                Jinnah was from a wealthy merchant background. His father was a merchant and was born to a family of textile weavers in the village of Paneli in the princely state of Gondal; his mother was from the nearby village of Dhaffa.[3] They had moved to Karachi in 1875, having married before their departure. Karachi was then enjoying an economic boom: the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 meant it was 200 nautical miles closer to Europe for shipping than Bombay.[6][7] Jinnah was the second child;[8] he had three brothers and three sisters, including his younger sister Fatima Jinnah.[9] Jinnah was not fluent in Gujarati, his mother-tongue, nor in Urdu; he was more fluent in English.[10][11][12] Except for Fatima, little is known of his siblings, where they settled or if they met with their brother as he advanced in his legal and political careers.[13] Some writers have referred to him as a Muhajir.[14] However, the use of the term "Muhajir", meaning "immigrant", in reference to his early life, is considered anachronistic by others as this term came into use after the partition in 1947, referring to Muslim refugees who migrated to Pakistan.[15]

                        As a boy, Jinnah lived for a time in Bombay with an aunt and may have attended the Gokal Das Tej Primary School there, later on studying at the Cathedral and John Connon School. In Karachi, he attended the Sindh-Madrasa-tul-Islam and the Christian Missionary Society High School.[16][17][18] He gained his matriculation from Bombay University at the high school. In his later years and especially after his death, a large number of stories about the boyhood of Pakistan's founder were circulated: that he spent all his spare time at the police court, listening to the proceedings, and that he studied his books by the glow of street lights for lack of other illumination. His official biographer, Hector Bolitho, writing in 1954, interviewed surviving boyhood associates, and obtained a tale that the young Jinnah discouraged other children from playing marbles in the dust, urging them to rise up, keep their hands and clothes clean, and play cricket instead.[19]
